; Settings used for the PlaySound setting
; General tips & notes:
; - try to use short sounds files
; - if you want to omit an action leave the key value below empty
; - for Beeps: durations below 40 are barily audible
; - for Windows/Media and User Sounds: you should be able to use relative paths if you wish
;   e.g. paste=..\..\paste.mp3 should play the sound file in the Lintalist root
