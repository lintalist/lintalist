Lintalist: Searchable interactive lists to copy & paste text, run scripts, using easily exchangeable bundles - https://lintalist.github.io/
(snippet manager, text expander)

# Introduction

Lintalist allows you to store and (incrementally) **search** and **edit texts**
in bundles and **paste** a selected text in your active program. The text **can**
be interactive, for example, you can automatically insert the current time and
date, ask for (basic) user input or make a selection from a list etc.

Other features:

* Assign keyboard shortcuts to your favourite Snippets
* Use abbreviations (shorthand) for your favourite Snippets
* Run scripts which can be included in a Bundle
* Use the standard Plugins (date, variables, counters, clipboard etc) or develop your own
* Read more in the documentation...

Lintalist is open source and developed in [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/),
an easy to learn scripting language for Windows (WinXP and above)

# AutoHotkey

Lintalist is written in AutoHotkey, a free and open-source utility for Windows. You can 
learn more about AutoHotkey at <https://autohotkey.com/>. The source code for AutoHotkey 
is available at <https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L>

**Note**: lintalist.exe is simply a renamed autohotkey.exe included for convenience.
This script requires a working copy of autohotkey.exe to be present in order to run
user scripts defined in bundles. If you have AHK installed you can safely delete
lintalist.exe and just start lintalist.ahk directly.
