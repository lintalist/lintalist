Lintalist allows you to store and (incrementally) **search** and **edit texts**
in bundles and **paste** a selected text in your active program. The text **can**
be interactive, for example, you can automatically insert the current time and
date, ask for (basic) user input or make a selection from a list etc.

* Use abbreviations (shorthand) for your favourite Snippets

Lintalist is open source and developed in [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/),

# AutoHotkey

Lintalist is written in AutoHotkey, a free and open-source utility for Windows. You can 
learn more about AutoHotkey at <http://ahkscript.org/>. The source code for AutoHotkey 
is available at <https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L>

**Note**: lintalist.exe is simply a renamed autohotkey.exe included for convenience.
This script requires a working copy of autohotkey.exe to be present in order to run
user scripts defined in bundles. If you have AHK installed you can safely delete
lintalist.exe and just start lintalist.ahk directly.
